# What Is Umar? 🤔

Umar is a collection of CLI commands I initially created to help me do various Linux tasks—I consider it a little Linux assistant.
Most of the time, I work on my personal laptop running Linux. It’s an OS where you’ll often deal with configuration and settings through the CLI.
At some point, I realized I was using the same commands repeatedly. Sometimes these commands weren’t simple; they needed to be chained together with
multiple other commands. So, I decided to create a tool to make those tasks easier.

    Not all my needs are covered by Umar yet, as it’s still being updated every day. Whenever I find something that should be reusable,
    I add it to Umar.

At the moment, I have tested Umar only on Arch Linux—because that’s what I use. I think it might also work on other distros,
but I’m not entirely sure. If you look at Umar’s source code, you’ll notice that some commands are written to be compatible with other distros,
but I haven’t tested them all.

You may also notice that some Umar commands are related to MacBook devices. That’s because I currently use a MacBook Pro 2017 13-inch with Arch Linux
as my main daily OS. These commands help me configure my MacBook to work seamlessly with Arch Linux.
