# An<br/>unexpected<br/>journey,

<img class="img-left" height="200" src="/assets/img/intro-pic.jpg" />Hello there, I'm <span class="stabilo">Dali Kewara</span>, a guy who lives and works as a <span class="stabilo">Backend Developer</span> in Indonesia—building useful and unexpected things, and trying to make positive impacts for people. I love to code and draw my own world—also, I have an interest in art, writing, and journey. I'm on an unexpected journey and going to make it simple yet spectacular!

### What am I doing in real life?

I have been working as a Software Engineer (Backend) for a living since 2016, at least for these companies:
**[Vascomm]({{ url.vascomm }})** (2016-2021), **[RCTI+]({{ url.rctiplus }})** (2022), **[Warung Pintar]({{ url.warungPintar }})** (2023) and currently **[Renos]({{ url.renos }})**.
After working hours, I sometimes enjoy myself by watching [solo bushcraft](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=solo+bushcraft+bertram+nagualero)
content on YouTube, listening to [Yorushika](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3sQKVJHpxisbBGGtC1mA4I?si=a5610bb4d8ce4048) on Spotify,
playing <span class="stabilo">The Legend of Zelda</span> and <span class="stabilo">Monster Hunter</span> on My Nintendo Switch—I also play [Dota]({{ url.steamUser }})—and traveling.

### I believe that helping others is one of the most important things to do as a human being

So, that's why sometimes I create packages
and hope they can be useful—here are the latest ones:

{% include "project-list-recent.njk" %}

### Want to know me more?

You can find me on these platforms:
