# An<br/>unexpected<br/>journey,

Hello there, I'm Dali Kewara, a guy who lives and works as a Backend Developer in Indonesia—building useful and unexpected
things, and trying to make positive impacts for people. I love to code and draw my own world—also have interest in art,
writing and journey (traveling). I'm on an unexpected journey and gonna make it simple but spectacular!

What am I doing in real life? Currently, I work as a Software Engineer (Backend) for living—at least I've worked for these companies:
**[Vascomm]({{ url.vascomm }})** (2016-2021), **[RCTI+]({{ url.rctiplus }})** (2022), and **[Warung Pintar]({{ url.warungPintar }})** (current).
After working hours, sometimes I enjoy myself by watching [solo bushcraft](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=solo+bushcraft)
contents on YouTube, listening [Yorushika](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3sQKVJHpxisbBGGtC1mA4I?si=a5610bb4d8ce4048) on Spotify,
playing [Dota 2]({{ url.steamUser }}), or traveling.

> My company allows me to **Working From Anywhere**—until further notice

I also love creating packages that might help people&mdash;bellow are the latest:

{% include "project-list-recent.njk" %}
