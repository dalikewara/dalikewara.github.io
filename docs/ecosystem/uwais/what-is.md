# What Is Uwais? ðŸ¤”

Uwaisâ€”formerly named ayapingpingâ€”is a standard project structure generator to build
applications that follow Clean Architecture and Feature-Driven Design concept in various programming languages
(such as Golang, Python, Typescript, etc). Uwais aims to be a seamless and very simple project structure while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

Keep in mind that this is not a framework. It's just a standard project structure. So, you will not be forced to follow the APIs that other frameworks require.
You're completely free to use your own API or implementation style{symbol.mdash}as long as you still follow the project structure.

Yes, the only thing you have to follow is the project structure itself. Uwais can't control your coding style, but Uwais can arrange your 
project structure so that everyone who looks at it will understand it because of its simplicity.
