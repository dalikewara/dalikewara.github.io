I want people to be able to understand each other, understanding other people's 
feelings—at least trying to understand—and make decisions not to offend others. 
We know, there are many sides to every life (problems). It's natural that we 
have our own side to side, maybe even that's how humans are, they walk with 
their own point of view.

If so, then it could be terrible! We—as creatures—are not fit to define that 
point of view. We ourselves understand, if what we think is good, is not 
necessarily the case for others, and vice versa. So we can't really determine 
what's right and what's wrong. The truth, gradually changes—according to ourselves. 
This causes a lot of unnecessary conflicts, such as blaming others, hating others, 
to being proud of yourself, making him/her immune to advice. Anything that is not in 
accordance with his/her thinking, is immediately considered deviant, 
regardless of the cause.

If humans understand that there are many sides to every problem, then humans 
should also understand that the truth can also be on many sides. We must try 
to understand other people, about how someone can come to do something—and 
deduce the truth from there. Finding the truth of what has been seen and happened 
is not the right thing to do. Because, the final result can be right or wrong, and 
we will spontaneously make unilateral decisions. For that, we really need to 
know how the process is—from something. The human heart is fragile, sometimes 
it can't accept sudden bad news, and sometimes even it can't be used to receive 
sudden good news. How will the heart conclude from the sudden news? Of course in 
the same way—we don't even have time to think about the causes and effects of 
the spontaneous thinking of our own hearts. We are forced to believe it.

By thinking about how other people feel, we will learn to control ourselves 
from excessive hatred and love. For example, judging from something bad that 
happened or someone did something bad, and we can see the bad 
by—trying—to understand it. We will try to think about the 
process, not the end result. Regardless of good or bad, we will always 
think that there will always be good things that we should hold on to. 
Why would he/she do that? Why? There must always be a reason, and every excuse 
has something to forgive—in human terms. We learn to endure hatred, 
cultivate love and patience. Given the reality of the diversity of human 
viewpoints, we must pay attention to that diversity, and not make decisions 
on the truth unilaterally. Of course, humans are not suitable for this. Humans 
will always obey their own righteousness—with their lusts. Although humans 
are social creatures, basically humans have the nature to destroy each other. 
Ironic.
