# Backward Compatibility

There are two types of versions:

- Uwais version: This refers to the version of the Uwais source code. Always update Uwais to the latest version to get the latest fixes and features
- Project Structure version: This refers to the version of the generated project structure. Different versions may produce different project structures, which is useful for ensuring backward compatibility
