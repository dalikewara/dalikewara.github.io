# ðŸ“– Legal & License

This website is powered by {link('docusaurus')}, hosted on {link('netlify')}, and its source code is available on {link('githubrepo')}.

This website is licensed under {link('gnugplv3')}, but not all content is covered by the same license. For example,
some tools or packages I created may have their own license, which will be explicitly stated in their repository or documentation page.
If you find content that does not explicitly state its license, it falls under this website's default license{symbol.mdash}{link('gnugplv3')}.
