# What Is Umar? ðŸ¤”

Umar is a collection of CLI commands I initially created to help me do various Linux tasks{symbol.mdash}I consider it a little Linux assistant.
Most of the time, I work on my personal laptop running Linux. Itâ€™s an OS where youâ€™ll often deal with configuration and settings through the CLI.
At some point, I realized I was using the same commands repeatedly. Sometimes these commands werenâ€™t simple; they needed to be chained together with
multiple other commands. So, I decided to create a tool to make those tasks easier.

> Not all my needs are covered by Umar yet, as itâ€™s still being updated every day. Whenever I find something that should be reusable,
I add it to Umar.

At the moment, I have tested Umar only on Arch Linux{symbol.mdash}because thatâ€™s what I use. I think it might also work on other distros,
but Iâ€™m not entirely sure. If you look at Umarâ€™s source code, youâ€™ll notice that some commands are written to be compatible with other distros,
but I havenâ€™t tested them all.

You may also notice that some Umar commands are related to MacBook devices. Thatâ€™s because I currently use a MacBook Pro 2017 13-inch with Arch Linux
as my main daily OS. These commands help me configure my MacBook to work seamlessly with Arch Linux.
