Jakarta and focuses in back-end development. Previously, he was worked as a Back-End Developer at
[![vascomm logo](assets/images/logo/vascomm.png#img-icon-wide-large){ loading=lazy }](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vascomm/){:target="_blank"}
in Sidoarjo for at least 4 years.

After working hours, he's sometimes relaxing 
himself by watching [solo bushcraft](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=solo+bushcraft){:target="_blank"} 
contents on :fontawesome-brands-youtube:{ .youtube } YouTube, 
listening to [Yorushika](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3sQKVJHpxisbBGGtC1mA4I?si=a5610bb4d8ce4048){:target="_blank"} 
on :fontawesome-brands-spotify:{ .spotify } Spotify, 
playing 
[Dota 2](https://steamcommunity.com/id/harukii_kun/){:target="_blank"}, 
traveling, or creating commercial & open source projects to help 
people solve their problems.

## Tech overview

As a Software Engineer, he used to work using following technologies:

| Languages | Databases | Message Channels | API | Event-Driven | Others
| :-------- | :-------- | :--------------- | :-- | :----------- | :-----
| :material-check:{ style=color:green } Python | :material-check:{ style=color:green } MySQL | :material-check:{ style=color:grey } RabbitMQ | :material-check:{ style=color:green } REST | :material-check:{ style=color:grey } Celery | :material-check:{ style=color:green } Docker
| :material-check:{ style=color:green } Golang | :material-check:{ style=color:green } Mongo | | :material-check:{ style=color:grey } gRPC | | :material-check:{ style=color:grey } Elasticsearch (APM)
| :material-check:{ style=color:yellow } JavaScript (NodeJS) | :material-check:{ style=color:yellow } Redis | | | | :material-check:{ style=color:green } Git
| :material-check:{ style=color:grey } PHP | | | | | 

!!! note
    The :material-check: check icon color indicates how often he uses that technology at current moment.
    :material-check:{ style=color:green } means very often, and :material-check:{ style=color:grey } is otherwise.

### JetBrains products

He uses **GoLand**, **PyCharm**, **WebStorm**, **PhpStorm**, and **DataGrip**&mdash;damn he really 
loves [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com){:target="_blank"} products so much!!! :fire:

### Containerization

In localhost, he uses **Docker** for most environment services such as databases, message channels, etc.
He likes to manage them in a single `docker-compose.yml` file or just wrapped all in a `Makefile`.

!!! info
    You can see [envidock](projects/docker/envidock.md) for more details.

## What you can found here?

As you can see in navigation menu on the left, there are sections that contain
all contents in this website. You can use search feature to find them quickly.

### Blog

Section to place blog articles. There is no specified category here, but mostly
articles are about his thoughts.

### Projects

Section to place documentation of his open-sourced projects&mdash;basically the most important part. This
is the main reason why he forms his website like a documentation page, because he wants to 
serve all of his open-sourced project documentation just in a single site.
