# Greeting 👋

{img('profilepic', '#md-left')} Hello there, I'm **Dali Kewara**, a guy who lives and works as a **{icon.mancoding} Backend Developer**
in Indonesia{symbol.mdash}building useful and unexpected things, and trying to make positive impacts for people. I love to code and draw
my own world{symbol.mdash}also, I have an interest in art, writing, and journey. I'm on an unexpected journey and going to make it simple yet spectacular!

The last sentence in the first paragraph is my motto. So yeah, I’m the kind of person who avoids complexity and just sees everything as something ordinary.
What makes me interested is simplicity and clarity. Take Go’s error handling, for example:

```go
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

A lot of people hate it, but to me, it's the best error handling ever {icon.fire}

## 🚵‍♂️ What am I doing in real life?

I have been working as a **Software Engineer (Backend)** for a living since 2016, at least for these companies:
- {link('vascomm')} (2016-2021)
- {link('rctiplus')} (2022)
- {link('warungpintar')} (2023)
- currently at {link('renos')}.

After working hours, I sometimes enjoy myself by watching {link('solobushcraft')} on YouTube, {icon.game} playing The Legend of Zelda
and Monster Hunter on My Nintendo devices (Switch & 3DS), and play Dota{symbol.mdash}turbo mode{symbol.mdash}on Steam (only if I get invited to a party).
I like traveling too, even though I don't do it very often.

I can sit in front of a monitor for hours doing coding{symbol.mdash}depends on the mood, btw. With so many cases and issues I've faced,
some of them pushed me to create tools or packages to make things easier. I also hope these tools can be useful for others.
You might find them on this website, as it’s intended to be a place where I document my work.

## How do I communicate? 🗣

I love explaining things in detail, but I'm not good at verbal communication, tbh {icon.sweatface}. I communicate better in writing{symbol.mdash}through text {icon.keyboard}.
