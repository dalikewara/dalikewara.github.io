Developer—building useful and unexpected things—in

Indonesia. He also has interests in art, writing and

!!! quote "*Make it simple but Spectacular!*"

## What does he do?

Currently, he works at [![rctiplus logo](assets/images/logo/rctiplus.png#img-icon-wide-medium){ loading=lazy }](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rctiplus/){:target="_blank"} as a Software Engineer in 
Jakarta and focuses in back-end development. 
He has also worked as a Back-End Developer at
[![vascomm logo](assets/images/logo/vascomm.png#img-icon-wide-large){ loading=lazy }](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vascomm/){:target="_blank"}
in Sidoarjo for at least 4 years.

After working hours, he's sometimes relaxing 
himself by watching [solo bushcraft](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=solo+bushcraft){:target="_blank"} 
contents on :fontawesome-brands-youtube:{ .youtube } YouTube, 
listening to [Yorushika](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3sQKVJHpxisbBGGtC1mA4I?si=a5610bb4d8ce4048){:target="_blank"}

## What you can found here?

all contents in this website.

Section to place blog articles. There is no specified category here, but mostly
articles are about his `Thoughts`.

### Projects

Section to place documentation of his open-sourced projects&mdash;basically the most important part. This
is the main reason why he forms his website like a documentation page, because he wants to
