# An<br/>unexpected<br/>journey,

Hello there, I'm **Dali Kewara**, a guy who lives and works as a Backend Developer in Indonesia—building useful and unexpected
things, and trying to make positive impacts for people. I love to code and draw my own world—also have interest in art,
writing and journey. I'm on an unexpected journey and gonna make it simple but spectacular!

**What am I doing in real life?** I've been working as a Software Engineer (Backend) for living since 2016—at least for these companies:
**[Vascomm]({{ url.vascomm }})** (2016-2021), **[RCTI+]({{ url.rctiplus }})** (2022), **[Warung Pintar]({{ url.warungPintar }})** (2023) and **[Renos]({{ url.renos }})** (current).
After working hours, sometimes I enjoy myself by watching [solo bushcraft](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=solo+bushcraft+bertram+nagualero)
contents on YouTube, listening [Yorushika](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3sQKVJHpxisbBGGtC1mA4I?si=a5610bb4d8ce4048) on Spotify,
playing The Legend of Zelda and Monster Hunter on My Nintendo Switch—I play [Dota 2]({{ url.steamUser }}) too—and also traveling.

I believe that helping people is the one of many important things to do as a human, so that's why sometimes I created packages
and hoping they can be useful—here are the latest:
